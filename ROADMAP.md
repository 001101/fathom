Ana Roadmap
===========

This is a general draft document for thoughts and todo's, without any structure to it.

### What's cooking?

- Archive `pageviews` table into daily totals for performance
- Create archive on-the-fly if it does not exist yet
- Bulk process tracking requests (Redis or in-memory?)
- Allow for multiple sites in same instance
- Update page title when it changes.
- Custom date range picker
- Choose a better name than "Ana"
- Envelope API responses
- Visual error handling on client-side.
- Geolocate IP addresses periodically.
- Mask last part of IP address.
