Ana Roadmap
===========

This is a general draft document for thoughts and todo's, without any structure to it.

### What's cooking?

- Never query `pageviews` table directly.
- Process tracking requests in bulk (Redis or in-memory)
- Split up `archive` table into specialised tables
- Allow for multiple sites in same Ana instance
- Custom date range picker
- Settle on a better name than "Ana"
- Envelope API responses
- Client-side error handling.
- Geolocate IP addresses periodically.
- Mask last part of IP address.
